BILDE

Hello there! :wave:

I am Adrian Mikkelsen Johannesse, an excited developer that loves to learn new things. I'm currently studying Front-End Development at Noroff University. Outside of developing I love to play video games and guitar. I enjoy coding and I've always been a fan of computers and tech, so the Front-End Development path was a natural choice for me.
